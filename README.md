Overview of the analysis

Purpose: 
     The objective of this analysis was to develop a dynamic website that enables users to sift through information related to UFO sightings. The website has been designed in such a way that it allows for comprehensive analysis of the sightings. Users can apply a variety of filters to the data table, including the date of the sighting, the city, state, country, and the shape of the UFO. Multiple criteria may be entered simultaneously in a single search.

Results:
    This image displays an instance of a search result obtained by utilizing two filter parameters. The search was conducted by filtering the UFO sightings based on the state of Florida and on the date of 1/11/2010.

Summary:
    The website runs successfully and the table can be filtered by different search criteria at once, however one needed improvement could be to add back the "update filter" button.
